Assessment One Project Proposal Code

The prototype I have prepared for this proposal features a few key coding concepts. A functional navigation bar, 
a logo which acts as an image link to a technology page and vendor and tutorial links to external resources related to the technology. 

To demonstrate a functioning navigation bar, you can navigate to all pages listed on the navigation bar but note that only the home page and C# page 
contain any content at this time. 

To navigate to the C# page, press the C# logo as seen on the home screen. The hyperlinks displayed on the C# are functional and following them 
will take you to the official vendor page and to a tutorial page. 

Detailed coding information can be found within coding comments in my prototype files. These comments can be seen in the index.html, 
cSharp.html and style.css pages.
